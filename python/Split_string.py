'''
Given a string S which consists of alphabets , numbers and special characters. You need to write a program to split the strings in three different strings S1, S2 and S3 such that the string S1 will contain all the alphabets present in S , the string S2 will contain all the numbers present in S and S3 will contain all special characters present in S.  The strings S1, S2 and S3 should have characters in same order as they appear in input.


Example 1:

Input:
S = geeks01for02geeks03!!!
Output:
geeksforgeeks
010203
!!!
Explanation: The output shows S1, S2 and S3. 
Example 2:

Input:
S = **Docoding123456789everyday##
Output:
Docodingeveryday
123456789
**##

Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function splitString() which takes the string S as input parameters and returns a list of strings containing S1, S2 and S3 respectively. If you return an empty string the driver will print -1.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

 

Constraints:
1 â‰¤ |S| â‰¤ 105
