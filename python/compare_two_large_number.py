'''
You will be given two numbers a and b. Your task is to print 1 if a < b, print 2 if a > b and print 3 if a = b.

Example 1:

Input: 
a = 1234
b = 12345
Output: 1
Explanation: a < b so answer is 1.
Example 2:

Input:
a = 100
b = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: a > b, so answer is 2.
User Task:
Your task is to complete the function check() which takes 2 arguments(string a, string b) and returns the answer. You need not take input or print anything.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|a| + |b|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|a| - |b|).

Constraints:
1 ≤ |a|, |b| ≤ 155      
'0' ≤  ai,bi  ≤  '9'

class Solution:

    def check(self, a,b):
        # code here
        if int(a)>int(b):
            return 2
        if int(a)<int(b):
            return 1
        else:
            return 3
