'''
Given a number S. Check whether it is divisble by 11 or not.

Example 1:

Input:
S = 76945
Output: 1
Explanation: The number is divisible by 11
as 76945 % 11 = 0.

â€‹Example 2:

Input: 
S = 12
Output: 0
Explanation: The number is not divisible
by 11 as 12 % 11 = 1.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function divisibleBy11() which takes the number in the form of string S as input and returns 1 if the number is divisible by 11. Else, it returns 0.


Expected Time Complexity: O(Log S) where S is the input number.
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1). 


Constraints:
1<=S<=101000+5

class Solution:
	def divisibleBy11(self, S):
		# Your Code Here
        if int(S)%11==0:
            return 1
        else:
            return 0
