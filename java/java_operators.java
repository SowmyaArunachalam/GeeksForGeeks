'''
Given two numbers you will have to check whether the first number is greater than or less than or equals to the second number.

Example 1:

Input:
A = 90
B = 5

Output:
90 is greater than 5.

Explanation:
Since A > B
So we print 90 is greater than 5.
Example 2:

Input:
A = 182
B = 234

Output:
182 is less than 234.

Explanation:
Since A < B
So we print 182 is less than 234.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read inputs. Your task is to complete the function relationalOperators() which takes two integers A and B and 

If A > B then print "A is greater than B" without quotes
If A < B then print "A is less than B" without quotes
if A = B then print "A is equal to B" without quotes

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1<= A,B <=109
