"""
There are times when your answer is a floating point that contains the undesired amount of digits after the decimal. Here, we'll learn how to get a precise answer out of a floating number. You are given two floating numbers a and b. You need to output a/b and decimal precision of a/b up to 3 places after the decimal point.
Note: You may use System.out.format()

Example 1:

Input:
a = 5.43, b = 2.653
Output:
2.0467393 2.047
Explanation:
a/b and decimal precision of a/b up to 3 places after the decimal point are given.
Example 2:

Input: 
a = 3.25, b = 2.5
Output: 
1.3 1.300
Explanation:
a/b and decimal precision of a/b up to 3 places after the decimal point are given.
User Task:

Your task is to complete the provided function printInFormat().
Note: You don't need to give a new line character after using System.out.format().
Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= a, b <= 109
